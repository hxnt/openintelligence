Exploring how to upload and download knowledge to/from the brain
### Mission
Create the ability to download the sum of human knowledge to a human brain using Neuralink or other BMI
### Questions
 1. How is knowledge stored in the brain?
 2. How can we represent that knowledge in a structured way?
 3. How can structured knowledge be read from and written to the brain?
### Philosophy
 1. It is important to distinguish knowledge from personality (if possible)
 2. At what % of brain/knowledge similarity are 2 people the same person? (if ever even at 100%) Or 1 person?
 3. 'Human will' collective of billions of human nodes
 4. How does innovation progress with full human knowledge sum equally distributed?
