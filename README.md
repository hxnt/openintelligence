Exploring how to upload and download knowledge to/from the brain.

At this point, this repo is just a sketch of ideas.

Please submit a pull request to add any ideas you may have.
### Mission
Create the ability to download the sum of human knowledge to a human brain using Neuralink or other BMI.
### Technology
#### Questions
 1. How is knowledge stored in the brain?
 2. How can we represent that knowledge in a structured way?
 3. How can structured knowledge be read from and written to the brain?
 4. What does merging a human collective with 'AI' look like at a low level?
 5. What is the bandwidth required between humans to reasonably upload & download knowledge?
### Philosophy
#### Questions
 1. It is important to distinguish knowledge from personality (if possible).
 2. At what % of brain/knowledge similarity are 2 people the same person? (if ever even at 100%) Or 1 person?
 3. How does innovation progress with full human knowledge sum equally distributed?
 4. Do people in a highly connected human collective still act as individuals?
 5. Democratic globalism = more future-proof? Or future conservative individualism layered amongst human collective ideas?
 6. Is individualism doomed? And if so, what are the effects?
#### Short-form Ideas
- 'Human will' collective of billions of human nodes.
- Ship of Theseus but with human brain and knowledge.
#### Long-form Ideas
- Today, it appears that people are increasingly thinking with a globalist/human collective perspective. This shifting of perspective appears to come from increasing connectivity between humans. With 'Brain Machine Interface' (BMI) technology around the corner, human connectivity is increasing at an increasing rate. Extrapolating these assumptions, human perspective appears to be approaching a limit of full collective think, where every person's actions are analyzed through the lens of benefiting the global human collective.
